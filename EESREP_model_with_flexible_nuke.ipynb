    "This serie of file \"Hands-on EESREP\" is dedicated to the study of flexibility features in the EESREP simulation model. The primary objective is to incorporate advanced components whose flexibility is in some way restricted by physical phenomena or safety regulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tutorial use_2_three_components_model.ipynb serves as the foundation for this code, which will introduce flexibility restrictions to the nuclear cluster in Hands-on EESREP, while the CCGT model will remain optimistic. Hence, the model uses seven main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   load: fatal sink that consumes a predetermined amount of energy ;\n",
    "\n",
    "-   FlexibleNPP: individual nuclear power plants that produce energy between its minimal and maximal power when turned-on ;\n",
    "-   cluster_CCGT: group of N2 Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) that produce energy between its minimal and maximal power when turned-on ;\n",
    "\n",
    "-   fuel_Nuke: provides the energy requested by the cluster_Nuke ;\n",
    "-   fuel_CCGT: provides the energy requested by the cluster_CCGT ;\n",
    "\n",
    "-   demand-side management: virtual production plant - that provides the system with unsupplied_energy - ensures the equilibrium between energy bid and ask. The energy is charged at a significantly higher rate compared to the rate of physical assets ;\n",
    "-   spilled_energy: physical consumption plant that will consume energy on demand to ensure an equilibrium between energy bid and ask when flexibility restrictions induce a spread. The charge for consumption is intended to prevent the solver from overproducing.\n",
    "\n",
    "A \"bus\" has been added to enable Kirchhoff's junction rule between the inputs and the outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model's structure can be exemplified as follows:\n",
